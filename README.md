## Hi there ðŸ¦Š
I am 22 years old GameDev, Content Creator and a human being. However, sometimes I am a fox :)
C#, C++, Java are my best friends. I also study on my own Music Production, Design and everything what seems interesting to me :)

Most time of the year I live in Finland. During the late Autumn and winter I reside in Southern Europe or move into other different directions. 

If you wanna contact with me send an envelope here: aurorakaunitz@gmail.com.
